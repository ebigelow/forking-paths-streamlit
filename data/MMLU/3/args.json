Which one statement is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\nA. The tea drinkers have lower risk of developing diabetes.\nB. The tea drinkers have higher risk of developing diabetes.\nC. Based on the information given we cannot tell if the observed difference in disease risk is the result of chance.\nD. The risk ratio is close to the value one, so there is no difference in disease risk between the two groups.\nAnswer: C\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct (according to knowledge in 2020)?\nA. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener aspartame\nB. Consumers with phenylketonuria must avoid the consumption of the sweetener saccharin\nC.

Animals are generally much less sensitive than people\nB. Such tests can detect only very large risks because of the fact that only small numbers of animals can be used\nC.
