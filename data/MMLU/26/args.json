All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble\nAnswer: D\n\nA new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?\nA. 3.89\nB. 7.78\nC. 5.78\nD. 2.33\nAnswer: C\n\nA solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?\nA. 0.500 mole\nB. 1.00 mole\nC. 2.00 mole\nD. 3.00 mole\nAnswer: C\n\nA mechanism is a sequence of elementary reactions that add up to the overall reaction stoichiometry.
