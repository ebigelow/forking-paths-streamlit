She already was able to sew  13 aprons, and today, she sewed three times as many aprons. How many aprons should she sew tomorrow if she wants to sew half of the remaining number of aprons needed?\nAnswer: Heather has sewn 13 x 3 = <<13*3=39>>39 aprons today.\nThe total number of aprons sewn is 13 + 39 = <<13+39=52>>52.\nHeather needs to sew 150 - 52 = <<150-52=98>>98 aprons more.\nSo, she needs to sew 98/2 = <<98/2=49>>49 aprons tomorrow.\n#### 49\n\nQuestion: Gondor is a technician, he earns $10 from repairing a phone and $20 from repairing a laptop. If he was able to repair 3 phones last Monday, 5 phones last Tuesday, 2 laptops on Wednesday, and 4 laptops last Thursday, how much does he earn in total?\nAnswer: Gondor was able to repair a total of 3+5= <<3+5=8>>8 phones from Monday to Tuesday.\nAnd the total amount he earned is $10x8= $<<10*8=80>>80.\nHe was able to repair a total of 2+4= <<2+4=6>>6 laptops from Wednesday to Thursday.\nSo, the total amount he earned is $20x6= $<<20*6=120>>120.\nTherefore, the total amount he earned is $120+$80= $<<120+80=200>>200.\n#### 200\n\nQuestion: A set of 7 spoons costs $21. If each spoon would be sold separately, how much would 5 spoons cost?\nAnswer: A set of 7 spoons costs $21, so one spoon from the set costs 21 / 7 = $<<21/7=3>>3.\nSo if sold separately, 5 spoons would cost 5 * 3 = $<<5*3=15>>15.\n#### 15\n\nQuestion: Connie redeemed all her arcade tickets today. She spent half of them on a stuffed koala bear. She spent 10 tickets on a pair of earbuds. She spent another 15 tickets on glow bracelets. How many tickets did Connie redeem today?\nAnswer: Connie spent 10 tickets on earbuds + 15 tickets on glow bracelets = <<10+15=25>>25 tickets.\nSince Connie spends half of her tickets on a stuffed koala bear, that means the 25 tickets she spent on earbuds and glow bracelets is the other half, so she spent 25 tickets on the stuffed koala bear.\nIn all, Connie spent 25 tickets on earbuds and glow bracelets + 25 tickets on a stuffed koala bear = <<25+25=50>>50 tickets.\n#### 50\n\nQuestion: Mark constructed a deck that was 30 feet by 40 feet.
