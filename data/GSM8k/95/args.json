At this same rate, how many peanuts could she eat in 6 minutes?\nAnswer: There are 60 * 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 seconds in 6 minutes.\nThen there are 360/15 = <<360/15=24>>24 sets of 15 seconds.\nSo, Darma could eat 24 x 20 = <<24*20=480>>480 peanuts.\n#### 480\n\nQuestion: Barney the dinosaur weighs 1500 pounds more than five regular dinosaurs combined. If each regular dinosaur weighs 800 pounds, find the combined weight of Barney and the five regular dinosaurs' weights?\nAnswer: If each regular dinosaur weighs 800 pounds, five regular dinosaurs weigh 5*800=<<5*800=4000>>4000 pounds.\nSince Barney the dinosaur weighs 1500 pounds more than five regular dinosaurs combined, he weighs 4000+1500=5500 pounds.\nThe combined weight of Barney and the five regular dinosaurs' weights is 5500+4000=<<5500+4000=9500>>9500 pounds.\n#### 9500\n\nQuestion: Heisenberg owns a pharmacy. He earned a total of $80 from 100 mg amoxicillin and $60 from 500 mg amoxicillin every week. If each capsule of 100 mg amoxicillin costs $5 and each capsule of 500 mg amoxicillin costs $2, how many capsules of amoxicillin does he sell every 2 weeks?\nAnswer: Heisenberg sells a total of $80/5= <<80/5=16>>16 capsules of 100 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 100 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 16 x 2= <<16*2=32>>32.\nAnd he sells $60/2= <<60/2=30>>30 capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin every week.\nSo, the total number of 500 mg amoxicillin he sells every 2 weeks is 30 x 2= 60.\nTherefore, the total number of capsules he sells every 2 weeks is 60 + 32 = <<60+32=92>>92.\n#### 92\n\nQuestion: Bryan bought three different bottles of milk. The bottles contain the following volumes of milk: 2 liters, 750 milliliters, 250 milliliters. How many liters of milk did Bryan buy in total?\nAnswer: Bryan bought a total of 750 + 250 = <<750+250=1000>>1000 milliliters of milk from the two smaller bottles.\nSince 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, then 1000 milliliters is equal to 1000/1000 = <<1000/1000=1>>1 liter.\nTherefore, Bryan bought a total of 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 liters of milk.\n#### 3\n\nQuestion: Tim's car goes down in value by $1000 a year.  He bought it for $20,000. How much is it worth after 6 years?\nAnswer: It went down in value 1000*6=$<<1000*6=6000>>6000\nSo the car is worth 20000-6000=$<<20000-6000=14000>>14,000\n#### 14000\n\nQuestion: Mark works at his job for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
