Each banana bread loaf is cut into 8 slices and wrapped individually for sale.  Each slice is sold for 50 cents for a fundraiser.  If she baked from 1:00 PM - 6:00 PM straight, and sold all the slices, how much did she raise in dollars?", "answer": "From 1pm - 6pm, there are 6 - 1 = <<6-1=5>>5 hours.\nIn 5 hours, Paige baked 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 banana bread loaves.\nWhen they are sliced, there are 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 banana bread slices.\nBy selling all the slices, Paige has raised 80 x 0.50 = $<<80*0.50=40>>40.\n#### 40", "input_formatted": "Question: Maria is chopping up vegetables for a stew. She wants to cut up six times as many carrots as potatoes, twice as many onions as carrots, and 1/3 as many green beans as onions. If she has two potatoes, how many green beans does she need to cut?\nAnswer: First find how many carrots Maria needs to cut by multiplying the number of potatoes by 6: 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12.\nThen find how many onions she needs by multiplying the number of carrots by 2: 12 * 2 = <<12*2=24>>24.\nFinally, divide the number of onions by 3 to find the number of green beans she needs 24 / 3 = <<24/3=8>>8.\n#### 8\n\nQuestion: Heloise has dogs and cats in the ratio of 10:17, with the total number of pets being 189. If she gives 10 dogs to her friend Janet, how many dogs does she remain with altogether?\nAnswer: The total ratio for the number of cats and dogs that Heloise has is 10+17 = <<10+17=27>>27\nFrom the ratios, the fraction representing the number of dogs is 10/27, and this represents 10/27*189 = <<10/27*189=70>>70 dogs.\nIf Heloise gives 10 of her dogs to Janet, she remains with 70-10 = <<70-10=60>>60 dogs.\n#### 60\n\nQuestion: Three-quarters of the oil from a 4000-liter tank (that was initially full) was poured into a 20000-liter capacity tanker that already had 3000 liters of oil. How many more liters of oil would be needed to make the large tanker half-full?\nAnswer: Three-quarters of oil from the initially full 4000-liter tank would be 4000*(3/4)= <<4000*3/4=3000>>3000 liters\nIn addition to the 3000 liters that were already in the large tanker, there are 3000+3000 = <<3000+3000=6000>>6000 liters in it now.\nThe tanker would be filled to half capacity by (1/2)*20000 = <<(1/2)*20000=10000>>10000 liters of oil\nThere are 10000-6000 = <<10000-6000=4000>>4000 liters left to reach half capacity.\n#### 4000\n\nQuestion: The building has 42 storage units that are a total of 5040 square feet. Twenty of the units are 8 by 4 feet each. If the remaining units are all the same size, what is the area, in square feet, for one of the remaining units?\nAnswer: 8 * 4 = <<8*4=32>>32 square feet\n20 * 32 = <<20*32=640>>640 square feet\n5040 - 640 = <<5040-640=4400>>4400 square feet\nThere are 42 - 20 = <<42-20=22>>22 remaining units\n4400/22 = <<4400/22=200>>200 square feet\nOne of the remaining units is 200 square feet.\n#### 200\n\nQuestion: James needs to get a new pair of glasses.  His frames cost $200 and the lenses cost $500.  Insurance will cover 80% of the cost of lenses and he has a $50 off coupon for frames.  How much does everything cost?\nAnswer: He gets 500*.8=$<<500*.8=400>>400 off the cost of lenses\nThat means the lenses cost 500-400=$<<500-400=100>>100\nThe frames cost 200-50=$<<200-50=150>>150\nSo he pays 100+150=$<<100+150=250>>250\n#### 250\n\nQuestion: Every hour, Paige can bake 2 banana bread loaves in the oven.
