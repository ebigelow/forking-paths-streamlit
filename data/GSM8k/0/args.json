She gives the dogs a bath twice a month. She gives the cats a bath once a month. She gives the birds a bath once every 4 months. In a year, how many baths does she give?\nAnswer: Each dog gets 24 baths a year because 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24\nEach cat gets 12 baths a year because 1 x 12 = <<1*12=12>>12\nEach bird averages .25 baths per month because 1 / 4 = <<1/4=.25>>.25\nEach bird gets 3 baths a year because .25 x 12 = <<.25*12=3>>3\nShe gives 48 dog baths because 2 x 24 = <<2*24=48>>48\nShe gives 72 cat baths because 3 x 12 = 36\nShe gives 12 bird baths a year because 4 x 3 = <<4*3=12>>12\nShe gives 132 baths a year because 48 + 36+ 12 = <<48+36+12=96>>96\n#### 96\n\nQuestion: There are 3 numbers that are consecutive integers. Together they have a sum of 18. What is the largest of the 3 numbers?\nAnswer: Let N = smallest number\nN + 1 = next number\nN + 2 = largest number\nN + (N + 1) + (N + 2) = 18\n3N + 3 = 18\n3N = <<3*5=15>>15\nN = <<5=5>>5\nThe largest number is <<7=7>>7.\n#### 7\n\nQuestion: Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly.  Helen won twice as many as Betsy and Susan won three times as many as Betsy.  Between them, how many games have they won?\nAnswer: Helen won twice as many games as Betsy's 5 so Helen won 2*5 = <<10=10>>10 games\nSusan won three times as many games as Betsy's 5 so Susan won 3*5 = <<3*5=15>>15 games\nWhen you combine their wins, together they won 5+10+15 = <<5+10+15=30>>30 games total\n#### 30\n\nQuestion: Two friends, Hubert and Ian, are planning to have a pizza party.

How much do they spend in all?\nAnswer: The number of boxes of pizza is 8 + 10 = <<8+10=18>>18 boxes.\nThe number of cans of soda is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25 cans.\nThe eighteen boxes of pizza cost 18 x $14= $<<18*14=252>>252.\nThe cost of 25 cans of soda is 25 x $1.80= $<<25*1.8=45>>45.\nTherefore, the total amount they spend is $252 + $45 = $<<252+45=297>>297\n#### 297\n\nQuestion: Greg drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market. After buying his groceries at the farmers market, he drives home. To get home, he travels for 30 minutes at 20 miles per hour.
