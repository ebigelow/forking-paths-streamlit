All of these should be delivered tomorrow. How many packages should be delivered tomorrow?\nAnswer: There are 80 x 2 = <<80*2=160>>160 packages today.\nSo, the courier will deliver 80 + 160 = <<80+160=240>>240 packages.\n#### 240\n\nQuestion: There are 30 different nuts in a bowl. If 5/6 of the nuts were eaten, how many nuts were left?\nAnswer: 30 x 5/6 = <<30*5/6=25>>25 nuts were eaten.\nThus, 30 - 25 = <<30-25=5>>5 nuts were left.\n#### 5\n\nQuestion: Bridge and Sarah have $3 between them. If Bridget has 50 cents more than Sarah, how many cents does Sarah have?\nAnswer: Let X be the amount of money Sarah has, so Bridget has X + 50 cents\nWe know that Sarah and Bridget combined have $3, or 300 cents, so X + X + 50 = 300\nWe therefore know that 2X = 250\nSo Sarah has 250 / 2 = <<250/2=125>>125 cents\n#### 125\n\nQuestion: Violet is planning a hike through the desert with her dog. Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour hiked and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour. If Violet can carry 4.8 L of water, how many hours can she and her dog spend hiking?\nAnswer: First find the total amount of water Violet and her dog consume per hour: 800 ml + 400 ml = <<800+400=1200>>1200 ml\nThen divide that amount by 1000 ml/L to convert it to liters: 1200 ml / 1000 ml/L = <<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2 L\nThen divide Violet's carrying capacity by the amount of water they drink per hour to find how many hours she can hike: 4.8 L / 1.2 L/hour = 4 hours\n#### 4\n\nQuestion: One US cup equals 250ml. Brian is making lasagna for himself, his wife, his two kids, his parents, and his wife's parents. The recipe requires 1/2 a cup of milk per serving. How many 1L cartons of milk does Brian need to buy if each person is expected to eat 2 servings?\nAnswer: There will be a total of (1) Brian + (1) Brian's wife + (2) two kids + (2) Brian's parents + (2) Brian's in-laws = 1+1+2+2+2= <<1+1+2+2+2=8>>8 people eating\nIf 1 person eats 2 serving of lasagna then 8 people will eat 8 * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 servings\nIf each serving requires 1/2 cup of milk then 16 servings require 16 * 1/2 cups = <<16*1/2=8>>8 cups of milk\nIf one cup of milk equals 250 ml, then 8 cups of milk equal 8 * 250 = <<8*250=2000>>2000 ml of milk\n1L carton of milk equals 1000ml of milk, therefore Brian needs 2000/1000 = <<2000/1000=2>>2 cartons of 1L milk\n#### 2\n\nQuestion: Mandy owes Benedict $100.
