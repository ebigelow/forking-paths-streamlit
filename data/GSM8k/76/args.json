She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?\nAnswer: Alice folds 1000 * 0.5 = <<1000*0.5=500>>500 paper cranes by herself.\nThis leaves 1000 \u2013 500 = <<1000-500=500>>500 paper cranes left to fold.\nA friend folds a fifth of the remaining amount, so they have folded 500 / 5 = <<500/5=100>>100 paper cranes for her.\nThis means there is a total of 1000 \u2013 500 \u2013 100 = <<1000-500-100=400>>400 paper cranes left for Alice to fold.\n#### 400\n\nQuestion: Troy bakes 2 pans of brownies, cut into 16 pieces per pan.  The guests eat all of 1 pan, and 75% of the 2nd pan.  One tub of ice cream provides 8 scoops.  If all but 4 of the guests eat the brownies ala mode (with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream), how many tubs of ice cream did the guests eat?\nAnswer: Troy bakes 2 x 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 brownie pieces.\n75% of one pan is 16 x 0.75 = <<16*0.75=12>>12 pieces.\nGuests eat 16 + 12 = <<16+12=28>>28 pieces.\nThis many guests eat the brownies ala mode 28 - 4 = <<28-4=24>>24.\nThis many scoops are eaten by the guests 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48.\nThe guests eat this many tubs 48 / 8 = <<48/8=6>>6 tubs.\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: Two friends, Hubert and Ian, are planning to have a pizza party. One box of pizza is worth $14, and a can of soda is worth $1.80. Hubert orders eight boxes of pizza and ten cans of soda. Ian buys ten boxes of pizza and fifteen cans of soda. How much do they spend in all?\nAnswer: The number of boxes of pizza is 8 + 10 = <<8+10=18>>18 boxes.\nThe number of cans of soda is 10 + 15 = <<10+15=25>>25 cans.\nThe eighteen boxes of pizza cost 18 x $14= $<<18*14=252>>252.\nThe cost of 25 cans of soda is 25 x $1.80= $<<25*1.8=45>>45.\nTherefore, the total amount they spend is $252 + $45 = $<<252+45=297>>297\n#### 297\n\nQuestion: Greg's PPO algorithm obtained 90% of the possible reward on the CoinRun environment. CoinRun's maximum reward is half as much as the maximum ProcGen reward of 240. How much reward did Greg's PPO algorithm get?\nAnswer: Half of much as ProcGen's maximum reward is 240/2=<<240/2=120>>120 reward\n90% of CoinRun's maximum reward is 120*.9=<<120*.9=108>>108 reward\n#### 108\n\nQuestion: Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. If Brenda weighs 220 pounds, what is Mel's weight?\nAnswer: Let Mel's weight be m\nBrenda\u2019s weight is 3*m + 10 = 220 pounds\nThus 3m = 220 - 10 = 210 pounds\nTherefore Mel's weight is m = 210/3 = <<210/3=70>>70 pounds\n#### 70\n\nQuestion: Lloyd has an egg farm.
