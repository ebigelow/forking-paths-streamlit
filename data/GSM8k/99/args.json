He trains twice a day for 4  hours each time for all but 2 days per week.  How many hours does he train a year?\nAnswer: He trains 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per day\nHe trains 7-2=<<7-2=5>>5 days\nSo he trains 8*5=<<8*5=40>>40 hour per week\nThat means he trains 40*52=$<<40*52=2080>>2080\n#### 2080\n\nQuestion: Sam went for a run in the morning. In the afternoon, he went grocery shopping and walked twice the distance through the store as he had run that morning. That evening, he went on a bike ride with his family and biked for 12 miles. In all, he went 18 miles that day. How many miles was Sam\u2019s morning run?\nAnswer: Let X be the distance Sam ran.\nHis walk through the store was twice the distance of his run, so his walk was 2X.\nHe biked for 12 miles and went 18 miles in all, so he walked and ran 18 - 12 = <<18-12=6>>6 miles.\nThus, his walk and run together were X + 2X = 3X = <<6=6>>6 miles.\nThus, he ran X = 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 miles.\n#### 2\n\nQuestion: If Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants, and he has 40 pants, what's the total number of pieces of clothes he owns if all other factors remain the same?\nAnswer: If Mr. Jones has 6 shirts for every pair of pants, and he has 40 pants, the total number of shirts he has is 6*40 =<<6*40=240>>240\nThe total number of pieces of clothes he owns is 240+40 = <<240+40=280>>280\n#### 280\n\nQuestion: Rose had 10 kilograms of rice. She cooked 9/10 kilograms in the morning and 1/4 of the remaining in the evening. How many grams of rice did she have left?\nAnswer: Rose cooked 10 x 9/10 = <<10*9/10=9>>9 kilograms of rice in the morning.\nShe had 10 - 9 = <<10-9=1>>1 kilogram of rice left then.\nOne kilogram is equal to 1 x 1000 = <<1*1000=1000>>1000 grams.\nSo, Rose cooked 1000 x 1/4 = <<1000*1/4=250>>250 grams of rice in the evening.\nTherefore, she has 1000 - 250 = <<1000-250=750>>750 grams of rice left.\n#### 750\n\nQuestion: An iron bar measures 12 cm by 8 cm by  6 cm. A factory wants to melt ten iron bars and mold them into iron balls. Each iron ball has a volume of 8 cubic cm. How many iron balls have been molded?\nAnswer: The volume of 1 iron bar is 12 cm x 8 cm x 6 cm = <<12*8*6=576>>576 cubic cm.\nThe volume of 10 iron bars is 10 x 576 cubic cm = <<10*576=5760>>5760 cubic cm.\nTherefore, there are 5760/8 = <<5760/8=720>>720 iron balls that have been molded.\n#### 720\n\nQuestion: Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills.
