How many legs are there in the room?\nAnswer: There are 4 tables, 1 sofa and 2 chairs that have 4 legs each so 4+1+2 =<<4+1+2=7>>7 pieces of furniture\nThese 7 pieces have 4 legs each so they have 7*4 = <<7*4=28>>28 legs\nThere are 3 tables with 3 legs each so they have 3*3 = <<3*3=9>>9 legs\nWe have 28 legs and 9 legs as well a 1 leg on a table and 2 on a rocking chair for a total of 28+9+1+2 = <<28+9+1+2=40>>40 legs\n#### 40\n\nQuestion: Lilith is trying to break the world record for largest cap collection. She collects 3 caps per month in the first year, and 5 caps per month after the first year. Each Christmas, she also receives 40 caps from friends and family.

If Lilith has been collecting for 5 years, how many caps has she collected so far?\nAnswer: In the first year, Lilith collects 3 caps * 12 months = <<3*12=36>>36 caps.\nEvery year afterwards, she collects 5 caps * 12 months = <<5*12=60>>60 caps.\nShe does this for a total of 5 \u2013 1 = <<5-1=4>>4 years.\nThis is a total of 60 caps * 4 years = <<60*4=240>>240 caps.\nIn total, she collects 36 + 240 = <<36+240=276>>276 caps by herself.\nOver the Christmases, she receives 40 caps * 5 years = <<40*5=200>>200 caps from friends and family.\nShe also loses 15 caps * 5 years = <<15*5=75>>75 caps over the years.\nShe has therefore collected 276 + 200 \u2013 75 = <<276+200-75=401>>401 caps.\n#### 401\n\nQuestion: A water tower that serves four neighborhoods around it holds 1200 barrels of water and is filled to the top each week. If one neighborhood uses 150 barrels of water in a week, the second neighborhood uses twice as many barrels of water as the first neighborhood in a week, and the third neighborhood uses one hundred more barrels of water than the second neighborhood in a week, how many barrels are left for the fourth neighborhood?\nAnswer: The second neighborhood uses 150 * 2 = <<150*2=300>>300 barrels of water.\nThe third neighborhood uses 300 + 100 = <<300+100=400>>400 barrels of water.\nThe first, second, and third neighborhoods together use 150 + 300 + 400 = <<150+300+400=850>>850 barrels of water.\nThus, the fourth neighborhood has 1200 - 850 = <<1200-850=350>>350 barrels of water left for it to use.\n#### 350\n\nQuestion: Mia can decorate 2 dozen Easter eggs per hour.
