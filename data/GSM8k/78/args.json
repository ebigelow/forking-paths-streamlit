She decides to buy one bracelet for each letter of the first name of her friends. Her friends are Jessica, Tori, Lily and Patrice. If each jelly bracelet costs $2, what is the total she will spend in dollars?\nAnswer: There are 7 letters in Jessica.\nThere are 4 letters in Tori.\nThere are 4 letters in Lily.\nThere are 7 letters in Patrice.\nIn all this is, 7 + 4 + 4 + 7 = <<7+4+4+7=22>>22 letters and thus 22 bracelets.\nThe total cost is 22 bracelets * $2 = $<<22*2=44>>44\n#### 44\n\nQuestion: A blind cave scorpion survives by catching millipedes. It needs to eat lots of millipedes to survive: a total of 800 body segments every day. If it's already eaten one millipede with 60 segments and 2 millipedes that are twice as long, how many 50-segment millipedes does it need to eat to reach its daily total?\nAnswer: First, the number of segments in the 2 millipedes that are twice as long is 60 segments * 2 = <<60*2=120>>120 segments.\nThen one can multiply the segments by the 2 millipedes to find the total number of segments: 120 segments/millipede * 2 millipedes = <<120*2=240>>240 segments.\nIn total, we then find the scorpion has eaten one 60-segment millipede in addition to the 3 millipedes above for a total of 60 + 240 = <<60+240=300>>300 segments.\nSo, the number of segments it still needs to eat are : 800 segments - 300 segments = <<800-300=500>>500 segments\nThus, it needs to eat an additional 500 segments / 50 segments/millipede = <<500/50=10>>10 millipedes.\n#### 10\n\nQuestion: A box holds 2 dozen doughnuts. If the family ate 8 doughnuts, how many doughnuts are left?\nAnswer: Two dozens of doughnuts are equal to 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 doughnuts.\nSince 8 doughnuts were eaten, therefore 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 doughnuts are left.\n#### 16\n\nQuestion: The owner of a small store divided the sugar into 12 packs. If each pack weighs 250 grams and has 20 grams of sugar left, how many grams of sugar did he start with?\nAnswer: The total weight of the 12 packs of sugar is 250 x 12 = 3 000 grams.\nThe owner started with 3000 + 20 = <<3000+20=3020>>3020 grams of sugar.\n#### 3020\n\nQuestion: A chocolate box contains 200 bars. Thomas and his 4 friends take 1/4 of the bars and decide to divide them equally between them. One of Thomas's friends doesn't like chocolate bars very much and returns 5 of his bars to the box. Later, his sister Piper comes home and takes 5 fewer bars than those taken in total by Thomas and his friends so she can also share with her friends. What's the total number of bars left in the box?\nAnswer: Thomas and his friends took 1/4*200 = <<1/4*200=50>>50 bars.\nThe total number of bars left in the box was 200-50 = <<200-50=150>>150 bars.\nSince there are five of them sharing, each of them got 50/5 = <<50/5=10>>10 bars.\nAfter a friend returned 5 bars, there were 150 + 5 = <<150+5=155>>155 bars in the box.\nPiper took five fewer bars, that is 50 - 5 = <<50-5=45>>45 bars.\nThe total remaining bars left in the box is 155 - 45 = <<155-45=110>>110 bars.\n#### 110\n\nQuestion: Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days; but on two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.
