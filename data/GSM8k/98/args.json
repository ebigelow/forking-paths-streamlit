From there, he drives 24 miles to his grandmother\u2019s house.  From her house, he drives 27 miles straight to his apartment.  How many additional miles did Kona drive round trip to the bakery stop, compared to a round trip without the bakery stop?\nAnswer: With the bakery stop, Kona drove a total of 9 + 24 + 27 = <<9+24+27=60>>60 miles.\nWithout the bakery stop, Kona drove a total of 27 + 27 = <<27+27=54>>54 miles.\nWith the bakery stop, Kona drives an additional 60 - 54 = <<60-54=6>>6 miles.\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: Emma buys 2 containers of milk every school day for lunch. She does not go to school on the weekends. How many containers of milk does she buy in 3 weeks?\nAnswer: There are 5 school days in a week: 5 days/week x 2 containers of milk/day = 10 containers of milk every week\nFinally the number of container for 3 weeks is 3 weeks x 10 containers/week = <<3*10=30>>30 containers\n#### 30\n\nQuestion: Toby wants to walk an average of 9,000 steps per day over the next week. On Sunday he walked 9,400 steps. On Monday he walked 9,100 steps. On Tuesday he walked 8,300 steps. On Wednesday he walked 9,200 steps. On Thursday he walked 8,900 steps. How many steps does he need to average on Friday and Saturday to meet his goal?\nAnswer: He needs to walk 63,000 steps in a week because 7 x 9,000 = <<7*9000=63000>>63,000\nHe has 18,100 steps to walk on Friday and Saturday because 63,000 - 9,400 - 9,100 - 8,300 - 9,200 - 8,900 = <<63000-9400-9100-8300-9200-8900=18100>>18,100\nHe needs to walk an average of 9,050 on Friday and Saturday because 18,100 / 2 = <<18100/2=9050>>9,050\n#### 9,050\n\nQuestion: Kiaan is doing home delivery of newspapers in his neighborhood of 200 homes. After an hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5 of the homes. After another 2 hours of working, he realizes he has distributed newspapers to 60 percent of the remaining homes. How many homes does he still need to distribute the newspapers to?\nAnswer: After the first hour of work, he has distributed newspapers to 2/5*200 = <<2/5*200=80>>80 homes\nThe number of homes that still need newspapers is 200-80 = <<200-80=120>>120\nTwo hours later, the number of homes he has distributed newspapers to is 60/100 * 120 = <<60/100*120=72>>72 homes.\nThe number of homes he still needs to distribute newspapers to is 120-72 = <<120-72=48>>48 homes\n#### 48\n\nQuestion: Brian has the same percentage of white stones and black stones in his collection of 100 stones as he does of grey stones and green stones in a separate collection. He has 40 grey stones and 60 green stones. How many white stones does Brian have if he has more white stones than black ones?\nAnswer: First we must determine the percentage of the grey and green stones. We add the two amounts together, finding 40+60=<<40+60=100>>100\nWe then figure out that 40/100=<<40/100=.4>>.4, meaning 40 percent of the stones are grey in the second selection.\nThis means that 1.0-.4= <<1.0-.4=.6>>.6, or 60 percent of the stones are green.\nSince there are more green stones than grey stones, and the white and black pile have the same percentage, and there are more white stones than black stones, that means there are 60 percent white stones in the first pile.\nTherefore, to find the number of white stones we multiply 100*.6= 60 white stones.\n#### 60\n\nQuestion: Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade.
