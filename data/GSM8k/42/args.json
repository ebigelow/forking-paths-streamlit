One in ten times, it will accidentally drop two snacks. The rest of the time, it drops the purchased snack. If thirty people have used the vending machine once each to purchase a snack, how many snacks has the vending machine dropped?\nAnswer: The vending machine has been used 30 times, so it has failed to drop a snack 30 / 6 = <<30/6=5>>5 times.\nThe vending machine has dropped 2 snacks 30 / 10 = <<30/10=3>>3 times.\nIt has operated normally and dropped 1 snack 30 - 5 - 3 = <<30-5-3=22>>22 times.\nThus, the vending machine has dropped 22 + 3 * 2 = 22 + 6 = <<22+3*2=28>>28 snacks in thirty uses.\n#### 28\n\nQuestion: Ursula went to the store and bought butter, bread, a package of cheese, and tea. The bread was 2 times cheaper than the butter, while the price of the butter was 80% of the price of cheese. Tea was the most expensive and cost twice the price of a package of cheese. If the tea cost $10, how much did Ursula pay for her purchases?\nAnswer: The price of the tea was twice the price of the cheese, so the cheese cost was 10 / 2 = $<<10/2=5>>5.\nThe price of the butter was 80/100 * 5 = $<<80/100*5=4>>4.\nIf the bread was 2 times cheaper than butter, that means it cost 4 / 2 = $<<4/2=2>>2.\nThat means Ursula paid for all her shopping 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 = $<<2+4+5+10=21>>21.\n#### 21\n\nQuestion: Michael has 2 cats and 3 dogs.
