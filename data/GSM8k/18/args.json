So he takes a bucket that holds 120 ounces and starts filling the bathtub. When it reaches the top, he sees that he filled it 14 times. Then he wonders how much bathwater he uses, so he starts taking away buckets until it gets to the level he puts it at. He needs to take away 3 buckets to do this. Finally, he wonders how much water he uses in a week for his baths, which he takes every day. How much water does he use each week?\nAnswer: He uses 11 buckets to fill his bath normally because 14 - 3 = <<14-3=11>>11\nHe uses 1, 320 ounces a day for his baths because 11 x 120 = <<11*120=1320>>1,320\nHe uses 9, 240 ounces a week for his baths because 7 x 1,320 = <<7*1320=9240>>9,240\n#### 9,240\n\nQuestion: Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?\nAnswer: First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 green marbles\nThen find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = <<60-20-10=30>>30 marbles\nDivide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 blue marbles\nFinally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = <<15/60*100=25>>25%\n#### 25\n\nQuestion: Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.
