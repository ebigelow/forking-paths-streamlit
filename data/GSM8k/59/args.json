She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. If a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, how much is the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device?", "answer": "Ada's weekly electric consumption before adding the new device is 12 x 7 = <<12*7=84>>84.\nSo, her weekly electric bill is 84 x $1.50 = $<<84*1.5=126>>126.\nAda's daily electric consumption after adding the new device is 12 + 2 = <<12+2=14>>14.\nSo her weekly electric consumption after adding the new device is 14 x 7= <<14*7=98>>98 kilowatts per hour.\nAda's new electric bill per week will be 98 x $1.50 = $<<98*1.5=147>>147\nTherefore, the difference between the bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $<<147-126=21>>21.\n#### 21", "input_formatted": "Question: Marcy spends 12 minutes petting her cat and 1/3 of that time combing it. How many minutes does she spend with her cat in total?\nAnswer: First find the time Marcy spends combing the cat: 12 minutes / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 minutes\nThen add that to the time spent petting the cat to find the total time she spends with it: 4 minutes + 12 minutes = <<4+12=16>>16 minutes\n#### 16\n\nQuestion: A school choir needs robes for each of its 30 singers. Currently, the school has only 12 robes so they decided to buy the rest. If each robe costs $2, how much will the school spend?\nAnswer: The school needs to buy 30 - 12 = <<30-12=18>>18 robes.\nSo the school will spend 18 x $2 = $<<18*2=36>>36.\n#### 36\n\nQuestion: Ray always takes the same route when he walks his dog. First, he walks 4 blocks to the park. Then he walks 7 blocks to the high school. Finally, he walks 11 blocks to get back home. Ray walks his dog 3 times each day. How many blocks does Ray's dog walk each day?\nAnswer: The number of blocks in each walk around the neighborhood is 4 blocks + 7 blocks + 11 blocks = <<4+7+11=22>>22.\nRay's dog walks 3 walks \u00d7 22 blocks/walk = <<3*22=66>>66 blocks each day.\n#### 66\n\nQuestion: Kaiden and Adriel were to pick a certain number of apples from their farm. After picking 400 apples each, they realized they still had to pick some more, so each picked 3/4 times as many as they had picked earlier. When they checked the pickup truck that was carrying the apples, they found out they still needed to pick 600 apples each to reach the target number. How many apples were they targeting to pick?\nAnswer: When they picked 400 apples each in the first round, they picked a total of 2*400 = <<2*400=800>>800 apples.\nThey picked 3/4*400 = <<3/4*400=300>>300 apples each in the second round.\nThe total number of apples they picked in the second round is 2*300 = <<2*300=600>>600\nThe total number of apples they'd picked so far is 800+600 = <<800+600=1400>>1400\nWhen they checked the pickup truck that was carrying the apples, they found out they still needed to pick 600 apples each to reach the target number, a total of 2*600= <<2*600=1200>>1200\nThe target number of apples they had to pick is 1200+1400 = <<1200+1400=2600>>2600\n#### 2600\n\nQuestion: Brenda picks 250 peaches. When she sorts through them, only 60% are fresh, and Brenda has to throw 15 away for being too small. How many peaches does Brenda have left?\nAnswer: First find how many of the peaches are fresh, which is 250 peaches * 60% = <<250*60*.01=150>>150 peaches.\nThen, subtract the number Brenda throws away after the fresh count, which is 150 peaches - 15 peaches = <<150-15=135>>135 peaches.\n#### 135\n\nQuestion: Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.
