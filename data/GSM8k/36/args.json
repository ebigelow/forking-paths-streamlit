If Cary burns 150 calories per mile walked, what's Cary's net calorie deficit (expressed as a positive number)?\nAnswer: First, find how many calories the walk burned by multiplying the calories burned per mile by the number of miles Cary walked: 3 miles * 150 calories/mile = <<3*150=450>>450 calories\nThen subtract the calories Corey ate to find the net calories Cary burned: 450 calories - 200 calories = <<450-200=250>>250 calories\n#### 250\n\nQuestion: In a bowl of fruit, there are 2 bananas, twice as many apples, and some oranges. In total there are 12 fruits in the bowl. How many oranges are in the bowl?\nAnswer: In the bowl, there are twice more apples than bananas, so there are 2 * 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 apples.\nThat means there are 12 - 4 - 2 = <<12-4-2=6>>6 oranges in the bowl.\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: Greta received 10 more letters in the mail than her brother. Greta's mother received twice the total number of letters Greta and her brother received.
