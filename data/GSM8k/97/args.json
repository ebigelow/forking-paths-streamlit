The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice the fourth grades' pass rate. What is the school's overall pass rate?", "answer": "First find the pass rate for the fourth graders: 40 students / 100 students = <<40/100=.4>>.4\nThen double that to find the pass rate for the fifth graders: .4 * 2 = <<.4*2=.8>>.8\nThen multiply the fifth graders' pass rate by the number of fifth graders to find the total number of fifth graders who passed: .8 * 400 fifth graders = <<.8*400=320>>320 fifth graders\nNow add up the number of passing students from each grade to find to find the total number of passing students: 320 students + 40 students + 340 students = <<320+40+340=700>>700 students\nAdd up the total number of students in each grade to find the total number of students: 400 students + 100 students + 500 students = <<400+100+500=1000>>1000 students\nFinally, divide the number of passing students by the total number of students and multiply by 100% to find the total number who passed: 700 students / 1000 students * 100% = 70%\n#### 70", "input_formatted": "Question: Cleo and Ignacio placed 30 of their marbles in a jar on a Monday. They took 3/5 of the marbles from the jar the next day and divided them equally. On the third day, Cleo took 1/2 of the marbles remaining in the jars. How many marbles did Cleo have on the third day?\nAnswer: On the first day, Cleo and Ignacio took 3/5 * 30 marbles = <<3/5*30=18>>18 marbles from the jar\nWhen they shared the marbles, each got 18 marbles / 2 people = <<18/2=9>>9 marbles/person\nThe total number of marbles remaining in the jar is 30 marbles - 18 marbles = <<30-18=12>>12 marbles\nOn the third day, Cleo took 1/2 * 12 marbles = <<1/2*12=6>>6 marbles from the jar.\nThe total number of marbles she has on the third day is 6 marbles + 9 marbles = <<6+9=15>>15 marbles.\n#### 15\n\nQuestion: Mark deposited $88 in a bank. Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark. How much did Mark deposit in the bank?\nAnswer: Five times the amount Mark deposited is $88 x 5 = $<<88*5=440>>440.\nSo, Mark deposited $440 - $40 = $<<440-40=400>>400.\n#### 400\n\nQuestion: Sandra has a box of apples that weighs 120 pounds.  She's going to use half the weight in apples to make applesauce.  The rest will be used to make apple pies.  She needs 4 pounds of apples per pie.  How many pies will she be able to make?\nAnswer: The box weighs 120 pounds and she's going to use half of it to make applesauce so she'll use 120/2 = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds for applesauce\nThe box weighs 120 pounds and she'll use 60 pounds for applesauce so that leaves 120-60 = <<120-60=60>>60 pounds of apples\nShe has 60 pounds of apples and she needs 4 pounds to make a pie so she can make 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 pies\n#### 15\n\nQuestion: Mrs. Petersons bought 10 tumblers for $45 each. She paid with five $100 bills. How much change will Mrs. Petersons receive?\nAnswer: The 10 tumblers amount to $45 x 10 = $<<45*10=450>>450.\nMrs. Petersons paid $100 x 5 = $<<100*5=500>>500.\nSo, her change will be $500 - $450 = $<<500-450=50>>50.\n#### 50\n\nQuestion: A kiddy gift shop sells bracelets at $4 each, keychains at $5 each, and coloring books at $3 each. Paula and Olive want to buy presents for their friends. Paula buys two bracelets and a keychain, while Olive buys a coloring book and a bracelet.
