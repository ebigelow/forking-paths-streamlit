How many fishes do they have altogether now?\nAnswer: Will caught 16+10= <<16+10=26>>26 fishes\nHenry caught 3 trout for each catfish Will caught so since Will caught 16 catfish, Henry caught 16*3 = <<3*16=48>>48 trout\nHalf of 48 trout is (1/2)*48 = 24\nHenry returned 24 trout leaving him with 48-24 = <<48-24=24>>24 trout\nThey now have a total of 26+24 = <<26+24=50>>50 fishes\n#### 50\n\nQuestion: Jackson works 5 days a week going door-to-door collecting for charity. His goal is to raise $1000 for the week. He earned $300 on Monday and $40 on Tuesday. If he collects an average of $10 for every 4 houses he visits, how many houses will he have to visit on each of the remaining days of the week to meet his goal?\nAnswer: First find the total amount Jackson still needs to collect: $1000 - $300 - $40 = $<<1000-300-40=660>>660\nThen subtract the number of days he already worked from the number of workdays in the week to find how many more days he'll work: 5 days - 2 days = <<5-2=3>>3 days\nThen divide the total amount he still needs to earn by the number of days he has to earn it to find how much he needs to earn per day: $660 / 3 days = $<<660/3=220>>220/day\nThen find how much money he collects per house: $10 / 4 houses = $<<10/4=2.50>>2.50/house\nThen divide the amount he needs to collect per day by the amount he collects per house to find how many houses he needs to visit per day: $220/day / $2.50/house = <<220/2.5=88>>88 houses/day\n#### 88\n\nQuestion: Annie has 6 barrettes, twice as many scrunchies as barrettes, and three fewer bobby pins than barrettes. What percentage of her hair decorations are bobby pins, rounded to the nearest percent?\nAnswer: First find the total number of scrunchies: 6 barrettes * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 scrunchies\nThen subtract three fewer bobby pins than barrettes 6-3 =<<6-3=3>>3 bobby pins\nThen add the number of each type of hair decorations to find the total number: 6 decorations + 12 decorations + 3 decorations = <<6+12+3=21>>21 decorations\nThen divide the number of bobby pins by the total number of decorations and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3 bobby pins / 21 decorations * 100% = 14.28 which rounds down to 14%\n#### 14\n\nQuestion: Ali had $21.
