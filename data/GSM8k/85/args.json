If she biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, how many miles did she bike in total in the two days?\nAnswer: Twice the distance Amy biked yesterday is 12*2 = <<12*2=24>>24 miles\nIf Amy biked 3 miles less than twice as far as yesterday, she biked 24-3 = <<24-3=21>>21 miles today.\nThe total distance she biked in the two days is 21+12 = <<21+12=33>>33 miles\n#### 33\n\nQuestion: Harry uses a whole bag of chocolate chips when he makes dough for chocolate chip cookies.
