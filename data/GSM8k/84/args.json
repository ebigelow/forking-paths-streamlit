What was the government profit from this project?\nAnswer: They gave money to 1000*.2=<<1000*.2=200>>200 people\nIt cost 200*2000=$<<200*2000=400000>>400,000\nThere was a 5 to 1 return so the government collected 5*400000=$<<5*400000=2000000>>2,000,000\nThat means the profit was 2,000,000-400,000=$<<2000000-400000=1600000>>1,600,000\n#### 1600000\n\nQuestion: Darma can eat 20 peanuts in 15 seconds. At this same rate, how many peanuts could she eat in 6 minutes?\nAnswer: There are 60 * 6 = <<60*6=360>>360 seconds in 6 minutes.\nThen there are 360/15 = <<360/15=24>>24 sets of 15 seconds.\nSo, Darma could eat 24 x 20 = <<24*20=480>>480 peanuts.\n#### 480\n\nQuestion: Lucy has been trying new recipes and wants to make sure she keeps the cupboard stocked with ingredients. She had a 500g bag of flour in the cupboard at the start of the week.

If Lucy wants a full bag of flour in the cupboard, how much flour does she need to buy, in grams?\nAnswer: After baking cookies, Lucy had 500 \u2013 240 = <<500-240=260>>260g of flour left.\nShe accidentally spilled half of this, which means she had 260 * 0.5 = <<260*0.5=130>>130g of flour left.\nShe therefore needs 500 \u2013 130 = <<500-130=370>>370g of flour.\n#### 370\n\nQuestion: Julia collects old watches.

She sees a 6-foot length of rope that cost $5 and also sees 1-foot lengths of rope that cost $1.25 each. What is the least she has to spend to get the rope she needs?\nAnswer: She needs 60 inches of rope because 10 x 6 equals <<10*6=60>>60\nThe six-foot length of rope is 72 inches long because 6 x 12 = <<6*12=72>>72\nThe six-foot length of rope would give her 12 pieces because 72 / 6 = <<72/6=12>>12\nThe six-foot length is long enough because 12 > 10\nEach 1-foot rope equals 12 inches\nShe would need 5 of the 1-foot ropes because 60 / 12 = <<60/12=5>>5\nIf she bought one-foot ropes it would cost $6.25 because 5 x 1.25 = 6.25\nThe cheapest rope to buy is the 6-foot rope because 5 < 6.25\n#### 5\n\nQuestion: Tommy is fundraising for his charity by selling brownies for $3 a slice and cheesecakes for $4 a slice.
