For every green toad, there are 25 brown toads, and one-quarter of the brown toads are spotted.  If there are 50 spotted brown toads per acre, how many green toads are there per acre?\nAnswer: If there are 50 spotted brown toads per acre, and this represents one-quarter of the brown toads, then there are 50*4=<<50*4=200>>200 brown toads per acre.\nIf for every 25 brown toads there is one green toad, then there are 200/25=<<200/25=8>>8 green toads per acre.\n#### 8\n\nQuestion: Alan likes to support music creators, so instead of downloading songs from the internet, he visits a record store once in a while. He decided now to buy 2 CDs by \"The Dark\", 1 CD by the creator \"AVN\", and 5 CDs that are mixes of songs from the 90s. The price of the \"AVN\" CD is $12 and it is half the price of one CD by \"The Dark\". The 5 CDs of 90s music cost is 40% of all the cost of all other CDs Alan is going to buy. How much will Alan have to pay for all the products?\nAnswer: If one \"AVN\" is half the price of one \"The Dark\" CD, that means one CD of \"The Dark\" costs 12 * 2 = $<<12*2=24>>24.\nSo for two \"The Dark\" CDs, Alan needs to pay 24 * 2 = $<<24*2=48>>48.\nSo all CDs cost by now 12 + 48 = $<<12+48=60>>60.\nThe 90s music CDs cost 40/100 * 60 = $<<40/100*60=24>>24.\nThat means for all CDs Alan needs to pay 60 + 24 = $<<60+24=84>>84.\n#### 84\n\nQuestion: Harold had 100 marbles. He kept 20 marbles and shared the rest evenly among his 5 friends. How many marbles did each friend get?\nAnswer: Harold shared 100 - 20 = <<100-20=80>>80 marbles with his friends.\nTherefore, his 5 friends got 80/5 = <<80/5=16>>16 marbles each.\n#### 16\n\nQuestion: A community is building a metal fence. Each fence panel is made of 3 metal sheets, and 2 metal beams. The fence is made of 10 fence panels. If each sheet is made of 10 metal rods and each metal beam is made of 4 metal rods, how many metal rods does the community need for the fence?\nAnswer: In each panel, the metal sheets use 3 metal sheets * 10 metal rods = <<3*10=30>>30 metal rods.\nIn each panel, the metal beams use 2 metal beams * 4 metal rods = <<2*4=8>>8 metal rods.\nSo each panel uses 30 + 8 = <<30+8=38>>38 metal rods.\nThe entire fence therefore needs 38 metal rods * 10 fence panels = <<38*10=380>>380 metal rods.\n#### 380\n\nQuestion: Ronald wants to make profits by re-selling some phones he bought a week ago. He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?\nAnswer: The profit Ronald wants is $3000 / 3 = $<<3000/3=1000>>1000\nThe profit per phone sold will be $1000 / 200 phones = $<<1000/200=5>>5/phone\nThe cost of each phone is $3000 / 200 phones = $<<3000/200=15>>15/phone\nThe selling price including the profit will be $15/phone + $5/phone = $<<15+5=20>>20\n#### 20\n\nQuestion: 44 seniors need to receive awards.
