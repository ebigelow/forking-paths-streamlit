If Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, what will the sum of their ages be in 5 years?\nAnswer: Since Will was 4 years old 3 years ago, then he is 4+3 = <<4+3=7>>7 years old now\nDina is twice as old as he is so she is 2*7 = <<2*7=14>>14 years old now\nIn 5 years, Will will be 7+5 = <<7+5=12>>12 years old\nIn 5 years, Diane will be 14+5 = 19 years old\nThe sum of their ages at that time will be 12+19 = <<12+19=31>>31 years\n#### 31\n\nQuestion: A retailer sells any shirt for the same price and any pair of pants for the same price, but the price of shirts and pants are not the same. Say you bought 2 shirts and 3 pairs of pants for $120 in total, then you realized you didn't need the extra pants. What's the price of 1 shirt at this place if when you returned all 3 pairs of pants you were refunded 25% of what you originally paid?\nAnswer: If I paid $120 and I was refunded 25% for all the 3 pants, then that means I received 25%*120=$<<120*25*.01=30>>30\nThis means the total price of the 2 shirts was 120-30 = <<120-30=90>>90\nThe price of one shirt is thus 90/2 = <<90/2=45>>45\n#### 45\n\nQuestion: Bill the miner discovers a vein of fool's gold. He successfully sells 8 ounces to a merchant, but when he tries to sell to the sheriff he's arrested, fined $50 and run out of town on a rail. If Bill earned $9 for every ounce of fool's gold he sold, how much money is he left with?\nAnswer: First find the total amount of money Bill made from the merchant: 8 ounces * $9/ounce = $<<8*9=72>>72\nThen subtract the fine to find how much money he was left with: $72 - $50 = $<<72-50=22>>22\n#### 22\n\nQuestion: It takes 7 years for an apple tree to bear fruit. If Lydia planted a tree when she was 4 years old and is now 9 years old, how old would she be when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time?\nAnswer: The tree has been planted for 9 - 4 = <<9-4=5>>5 years\nIt will take another 7 - 5 = <<7-5=2>>2 years for it to bear fruit\nLydia will be 9 + 2 = <<9+2=11>>11 years old\n#### 11\n\nQuestion: Augustus can make 3 milkshakes per hour while Luna can make 7 milkshakes per hour. If Augustus and Luna have been making milkshakes for 8 hours now, how many milkshakes have they made?\nAnswer: Augustus and Luna can make a total of 3 + 7 = <<3+7=10>>10 milkshakes per hour.\nTherefore, they made a total of 10 x 8 = <<10*8=80>>80 milkshakes in 8 hours.\n#### 80\n\nQuestion: Kris is trying to earn a video game achievement for playing a total of 30 hours.
