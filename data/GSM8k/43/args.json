Each floor is 3 meters high, except for the last two floors. The last two floors are each 0.5 meters higher. How tall is the building?\nAnswer: There are 20 - 2 = <<20-2=18>>18 floors that are each 3 meters high.\nSo the first 18 floors is 18 x 3 = <<18*3=54>>54 meters high.\nThe last two floors are each 3 + 0.5 = <<3+0.5=3.5>>3.5 meters high.\nSo the total height of the last two floors is 3.5 x 2 = <<3.5*2=7>>7 meters.\nTherefore, the building is 54 + 7 = <<54+7=61>>61 meters high.\n#### 61\n\nQuestion: A box holds 2 dozen doughnuts. If the family ate 8 doughnuts, how many doughnuts are left?\nAnswer: Two dozens of doughnuts are equal to 2 x 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 doughnuts.\nSince 8 doughnuts were eaten, therefore 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 doughnuts are left.\n#### 16\n\nQuestion: The rim of a standard basketball hoop is 10 feet above the ground.  Additionally, most experts will say that a player must be able to reach at least 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball.  Suppose a basketball player is 6 feet tall and can reach 22 inches above their head using the wingspan of their arms.  How high must this player be able to jump to reach 6 inches above the rim to dunk a basketball?\nAnswer: In inches, the height of the rim is 10*12 = <<10*12=120>>120 inches.\nThus, the height that the player needs to be able to reach is 120 + 6 = <<120+6=126>>126 inches.\nWithout jumping, the player can reach their height plus an additional 22 inches, or a total of 6*12 + 22 = <<6*12+22=94>>94 inches.\nTherefore, the player needs to jump 126 - 94 = <<126-94=32>>32 inches to reach the height required to dunk a basketball.\n#### 32\n\nQuestion: A machine fills 150 cans of paint every 8 minutes. How many minutes does it take this machine to fill 675 cans?\nAnswer: To know how many groups of 150 cans there are in 675 cans, we calculate 675 \u00f7 150 = <<675/150=4.5>>4.5.\nFor each of these groups, 8 minutes are needed, so it takes 8 \u00d7 4.5 = <<8*4.5=36>>36 minutes.\n#### 36\n\nQuestion: James goes to pet smart to adopt a puppy.  The adoption fee is $200 and his friend agrees to pay 25% of that.  How much does James have to pay?\nAnswer: His friend agrees to pay 200*.25=$<<200*.25=50>>50\nSo he needs to pay 200-50=$<<200-50=150>>150\n#### 150\n\nQuestion: Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?\nAnswer:", "index": 43}}
