He takes a whole, uncut pepperoni pizza and cuts it in half.  He then cuts these halves in half and gives one of the slices to Jelly.  Assuming the pizza started with 40 evenly spread slices of pepperoni, how many slices of it are on the slice Lard gives Jelly if 1 of them falls off the slice when Lard picks it up?\nAnswer: First, we need to determine how many slices the pizza was cut into. To do this, we start by performing 1*2= <<1*2=2>>2 slices after the pizza was cut in half once.\nEach of these slices was cut in half again, yielding 2*2= <<2*2=4>>4 slices in total.\nNext, we divide the total amount of pepperoni slices by the number of pizza slices, as the pepperoni was spread evenly. We find there are 40/4= <<40/4=10>>10 slices of pepperoni per pizza slice.\nSince 1 slice of pepperoni fell off Jelly's slice, this means there are 10-1=<<10-1=9>>9 slices left on her slice.\n#### 9\n\nQuestion: There are 14 green papayas on the papaya tree.  On Friday, two of the fruits turned yellow.  On Sunday, twice as many fruits as on Friday turn yellow.  How many green papayas are left on the tree?\nAnswer: On Sunday 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 papayas turned yellow.\nA total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 papayas turned yellow.\nThere are 14 - 6 = <<14-6=8>>8 green papayas still left on the tree.\n#### 8\n\nQuestion: 8 jumbo scallops weigh one pound and cost $24.00 a pound.  Nate is pairing 2 scallops with a corn bisque as a light summer dinner.  He\u2019s cooking for 8 people.  How much will the scallops cost?\nAnswer: He\u2019s cooking for 8 people and wants to serve 2 scallops per person so he needs 8*2 = <<8*2=16>>16 scallops\n8 jumbo scallops come in 1 pound and he needs 16 scallops so he will need 16/8 = <<16/8=2>>2 pounds of scallops\nA pound of scallops weigh $24.00 and he needs 2 pounds so it will cost him 24*2 = $<<24*2=48.00>>48.00 for scallops\n#### 48\n\nQuestion: Central Park had 8 more than half of the number of trash cans as in Veteran's Park.  Then one night, someone took half of the trash cans from Central Park and put them in Veteran's Park.  If originally there were 24 trash cans in Veteran's Park, how many trash cans are now in Veteran's Park?\nAnswer: Half the original number of trash cans in Veteran's Park is 24/2=<<24/2=12>>12 trash cans.\nThus Central Park originally had 8 more than half the number of trash cans as what was originally in Veteran's Park, or 12+8=<<8+12=20>>20 trash cans.\nHalf of the trash cans from Central Park is 20/2=<<20/2=10>>10 trash cans.\nAfter the addition of the 10 new cans, there are now 24+10=<<24+10=34>>34 trash cans in Veteran's Park.\n#### 34\n\nQuestion: Maddox and Theo both bought 3 Polaroid Cameras, each sold at $20 per camera from Amazon, and decided to sell them on eBay.
