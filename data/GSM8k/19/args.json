If Violet randomly picks a candy from the bag, how likely is it that it's blue?\nAnswer: The total of candies is 5 + 3 + 4 = <<5+3+4=12>>12 candies.\nThe probability of a candy being blue is (3/12) * 100% = 25%.\n#### 25\n\nQuestion: A fruit basket consists of 4 bananas, 3 apples, 24 strawberries, 2 avocados, and a bunch of grapes. One banana costs $1. An apple costs $2. 12 strawberries cost $4. An avocado costs $3, and half a bunch of grapes costs $2. What is the total cost of the fruit basket?\nAnswer: The bananas cost 4 x $1 = $<<4*1=4>>4\nThe apples cost 3 x $2 = $<<3*2=6>>6\nThe strawberries cost (24/12) x $4 = $<<(24/12)*4=8>>8\nThe avocados cost 2 x $3 = $<<2*3=6>>6\nThe grapes cost 2 x $2 = $<<2*2=4>>4\nThe total cost of the fruit basket is $4 + $6 + $8 + $6 + $4 = $<<4+6+8+6+4=28>>28\n#### 28\n\nQuestion: 4.5 gallons of coffee were divided among 18 thermoses. Genevieve drank 3 thermoses. How many pints of coffee did Genevieve drink?\nAnswer: 4.5 gallons = 4.5 * 8 pints = <<4.5*8=36>>36 pints\n36/18 = <<36/18=2>>2 pints\nGenevieve drank 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 pints of coffee.\n#### 6\n\nQuestion: Georgie is a varsity player on a football team. He can run 40 yards within 5 seconds. If he can improve his speed by forty percent, how many yards will he be able to run within 10 seconds?\nAnswer: The additional yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 x 40/100 = <<40*40/100=16>>16 yards.\nSo the total yard he will be able to run to after improving his speed is 40 + 16 = <<40+16=56>>56 yards in 5 seconds.\nTherefore the total yards he will be able to run to within 10 seconds is 56 x 2 = <<56*2=112>>112.\n#### 112\n\nQuestion: Mr. Mayer bought Corgi dogs for $1000 each. He plans to sell them with a 30% profit.
